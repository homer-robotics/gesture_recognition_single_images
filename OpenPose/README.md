## OpenPose

This is essentially a slightly modified version of OpenPose as described in [this LearnOpenCV tutorial](https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-human-pose-estimation-using-opencv-cpp-python/). You can also get a C++ version there.

### Running it:
* You need OpenCV version **3.4.1** or newer. I tested it with version 3.4.3.
* You can use the COCO or MPI model for the pose extraction, the models are not included here due to their size. Therefore you need to run ```getModels.sh``` first.
